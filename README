dockeye_multi is an interactive graphical tool 
to dock ligands/drugs to protein targets.
It works as a plugin to PyMol,
which is used as a graphic rendering engine.
it may also be used as a tool to analyze the
favorable and unfavorable interactions in a
known ligand-target complex

directories:
===============================
src (source files, shared object file, makefile)
 sub_directories src_c, src_f contain the C and
 Fortran versions of the dockeye backend. The C version
 is was primarily developed for 32 bit versions of PyMol. 
 The Fortran version is a straight
 translation using f2py, and was developed to avoid problems
 with interfacing C and Python 3.X on Mac OS
 Both produce a module importable into Python 
 The C version has been tested and works for PyMol
 distros 1.9-2.2 running Python2.7 on Linux, MacOS
 The FORTRAN version has been tested and works for PyMol2.X
 distros running Python3.6/7/8 on Linux, MacOS

example (all files needed to run the examples 
 trypsin/benzamidine, carbonic anhydrade, 
 interleukin and antibody_digoxin)
