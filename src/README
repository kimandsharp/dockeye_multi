dockeye_multi code
--------------------
dockeyeM_energy.c  C code backend interaction energy compute engine
                   (as of june 2020, this now lives in the src_c subdirectory;
                   (a Fortran version is in src_f)
dockeyeM_energy_XX.so  shared object file compiled from dockeyeM_energy(.c/.f)
                   as an importable Python module
                   (this is produced by the makefile in either the src_c or src_f 
                   subdirectory depending on language used, and it should
                   be pointed to by a soft link named dockeyeM_energy.so in
                   the parent directory, src)
dockeyeM_c_vX.Y.py  version X.Y python code run within PyMol, which 
                   implements the graphical front end. Imports the
                   module dockeyeM_energy from dockeyeM_energy.so
                   to run the backend
dockeyeM_c.py      logical link to specific version code, 
dockeye_methods.py defs/classes/methods 
matrix3.py         basic vector/matrix ops for make_conformers.py

helper/prep programs
dockeye_prep.py    optional prep stage. Using your pdb format files,
                   will nicely position your
                   protein and ligand ready for dockeye
                   note this does NOT do the charge/radius assignment
                   and pasting into the occupancy and b-factor fields
                   prep step: that can be done several ways depending
                   on how your charges are assigned.
pdbqt_to_pdb.py    reads pdbqt format coordinate file output from autodock tools,
                   moves autdock charges into bfactor field, and assigns radii.
                   use on protein target pdbqt file and on ligand pdbqt file 
make_conformers.py generates a ligand *.pdb file for use with dockeye_multi
                   reads the torsion/root/branch records placed inside a pdb file
                   by the vina autodock tool, adt. 
                   the output file contains multiple ligand conformers based
                   on 3 rotation angles around specified torsions 
                   each conformer delimited by MODEL/ENDMDL
make_conformers_flip.py does everything make_conformers.py does, then produces
                   the three 180o flipped versions of each conformer (so 4x
                   as many conformers in total - this can be large!)
psf_to_atm.py      extracts charges from charm/namd *.psf file, and
                   pastes these plus atomic radii into a pdb file

post-dockeye
dockeyeM_getpose.py extracts low energy ligand poses from the dockeye
                   logfile into a pdb format file, also makes a movie
                   of all the poses

to use dockeye_multi within PyMol this src directory must be added
to your PYTHONPATH environment variable

for more information on the way to use the various programs, see the 
dockeye_workflow.pdf document in the parent directory.
