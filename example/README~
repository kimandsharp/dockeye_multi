Everything needed for dockeye examples
assuming that you have PyMol installed
and that the src directory where the dockeye module (shared object file)
and other methods files reside, has been added to the PYTHONPATH
environment variable
-------------------------------------------------------
required files
-------------------------------------------------------
<protein_binding_site>.pdb
        pdb format file of protein with radii
        and charges in the occupancy and B_factor fields)

<ligand>.pdb
        pdb format file of ligand with radii
        and charges in the occupancy and B_factor fields
        and a set of conformer coordinates, each 
        delimited by 
        MODEL
        ENDMDL
        records

setup.pml (optional) when run from within PyMol
        it invokes runs the dockeye python code
        to load the dockeye plugin, 
        and setups some nice display settings
        for dockeye. only the first line:
        de('<protein_pdbfile>','<ligand_pdbfile>')
        is required to run dockeye, and this can be typed
        directly into the command window if you like)

-------------------------------------------------------
running
-------------------------------------------------------
1) Start up Pymol

2) Either run the file dockeyeM_c.py in the
src directory from within PyMol, or put a line like
run ~/source/dockeye_multi/src/dockeyeM_c.py
in the file .pymolrc in your home directory
to automatically run it every time you start up 
PyMol

3) Run the file setup.pml from 
PyMol (optional) or type
de('<protein_pdbfile>','<ligand_pdbfile>')
in the command window

other default command line options that can be overidden are:
charges=True,logscale=True,dielectric=80.,eps=0.1

4)
change to 3 button mouse editing

5)
mouse over the ligand and hold down shift key: translations
and rotations then apply to that molecule only. Release shift key to
apply global trans, rot.

dockeye object refresh can be paused by deselecting the dockeye object
in the object menu

6)
the dockeye plugin creates new graphical elements:

A)
the protein-ligand interaction energy bars on the left:
electrostatic, van der Waals, total
red = positive energy, blue = negative energy.
there is a green 'low water mark' which marks the best
(most -ve) energy so far.
each time a new low is discovered, the pose is written to a
date/time-stamped log file.

(ligand pdb files can be generated later from these stored
poses by running dockeyeM_getpose.py on the log file and
selecting any of the poses)

B)
the 'dockeye object' named in the pymol object menu
dockeye_obj:
A set of colored circles characterizing
the interaction between ligand and protein.
For every ligand-protein atomic pair interaction above some
absolute energy cutoff (+-ve or -ve), 
a circle is generated. Its position is midway between
the atom pairs, oriented perpedicular to line joining the
two atoms. Its radius varies inversely with distance,
and it is color coded according to the sign of the total 
pair interaction energy

In brief, the 'Game' you are playing is
to move that green bar downwards, by surrounding the ligand
by as many blue cicles as you can get, and avoiding those red circles!

Absence/presence, position, orientation and colors of circles give you
visual clues about extent of shape, chemical complementarity,
where are the good, bad or missing interactions,
and how to re-position the ligand.

Good Luck!
